Scripts were originally from the Plankline project controlled by OSU (citation\textquotesingle{}s to be included). I have heavily modified and repurposed the code to suit our architecture and to improve logging and performance. These scripts are available as is and I make no claim to ownership or control of any potentially sensitive code. These are intended for in-\/house use at UAF.\hypertarget{md__home_thomas__github__u_a_f__plankline_readme_autotoc_md33}{}\doxysection{Setup and Documentation}\label{md__home_thomas__github__u_a_f__plankline_readme_autotoc_md33}
The Plankline suite of processing scripts is split into three main modules\+: (1) segmentation, (2) classification, (3) analysis; and is unified with the scripts in this repository.

If you are new to linux and setting up a Plankline instance for the first time, please start with the Linues Setup and the Notes/\+General\%20\+Setup.\+md \char`\"{}\+Plankline Setup\char`\"{} guides.

For documentation on how Plankline works, please see the \mbox{\hyperlink{md__home_thomas__github__u_a_f__plankline__notes__plankline}{Plankline}} reference.

Optionally we also have a preliminary Morphocluster setup guide for those that are interested.\hypertarget{md__home_thomas__github__u_a_f__plankline_readme_autotoc_md34}{}\doxysection{Quick start}\label{md__home_thomas__github__u_a_f__plankline_readme_autotoc_md34}
To run plankline with a specific configuration file and input directory\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}python3 segmentation.py -c <ini> -d <dir>
python3 classification.py -c <ini> -d <dir>
\end{DoxyVerb}
 So for example\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}python3 segmentation.py -c osu_test_config.ini -d /media/plankline/data/test_data
\end{DoxyVerb}
