[segmentation]
## visual (default False): Flag to turn on or off "WITH_VISUAL" compilation flag for segment.
## segment_processes (default 1): Number of python threads to run segmentation on. Segmentation is already multithreaded, recommended value here is 1.
## segment_processes_visual (no default): Number of python threads to run visual segment on.
## signal_to_noise (default 50):
## segment: Path to the segment executable.
## full_output (default blank): Flag to turn on/off generation of bounding box and corrected image tiffs. Takes ~3x longer when on. "-f" for on, "" for off.
## overlap (default 0): Decimal between 0 and 1 to control the amount of allowable overlap between ROIs. 0 = no overlap. 1 = full overlap.
## max_area (default 400000):
## min_area (default 50):
## delta (default 4):
## fast_scratch (default /tmp): Location to write temporary files. Will be deleted at the end of the run. Recommend to be in memory if possible.
