## python:      Absolute path to python3 executable [e.g. /usr/bin/python3]
## ffmpeg:      Absolute path to ffmpeg executable [e.g. /usr/bin/ffmpeg]
## ffprobe:     Absolute path to ffprobe executable [e.g. /usr/bin/ffprobe]
## compress_output:     Boolean flag to gzip tar files or not [options: True/False]

[segmentation]
## visual:          [False] Flag to turn on or off "WITH_VISUAL" compilation flag for segment.
## segment_processes: [1]   Number of python threads to run segmentation on. Segmentation is already multithreaded, recommended value here is 1.
## segment_processes_visual: []       Number of python threads to run visual segment on.
## signal_to_noise: [50]    Still not sure.        
## segment:                 Path to the segment executable.
## full_output:     [-f]    Flag to turn on/off generation of bounding box and corrected image tiffs. Takes ~3x longer when on. "-f" for on, "" for off.
## overlap:         [0]     Decimal between 0 and 1 to control the amount of allowable overlap between ROIs. 0 = no overlap. 1 = full overlap.
## max_area:        [400000]
## min_area:        [50]
## delta:           [4]
## fast_scratch:    [/tmp]  Location to write temporary files. Will be deleted at the end of the run. Recommend to be in memory if possible.

## epoch:           []      Training epoch to use for the classification.
