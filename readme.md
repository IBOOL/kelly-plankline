# Plankline Scripts
Scripts were originally from the Plankline project controlled by OSU (citation's to be included). I have heavily modified and repurposed the code to suit our architecture and to improve logging and performance. These scripts are available as is and I make no claim to ownership or control of any potentially sensitive code. These are intended for in-house use at UAF.
